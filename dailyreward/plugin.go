// Package dailyreward is a loon plugin: a home-page card where a signed-in user
// claims a daily reward — once per day, behind a captcha — for points and a
// growing streak. It shows off composing several core seams at once: the view
// system (a SlotSiteWidget card), a plugin route for the claim POST, the points
// ledger (core.Points), schema-scoped storage, and the host's CAPTCHA exposed
// as a cross-cutting capability.
//
// The captcha is looked up structurally off the extension registry (key
// "captcha"), so this plugin never imports the host's captcha package.
//
// Two cases that look identical from here and are not: a host that registered
// NO captcha has chosen not to gate, and the claim runs ungated (safe enough
// behind auth + once-per-day; logged at boot so it is a choice rather than a
// surprise). A host that registered one we cannot use has a wiring bug, and
// booting anyway would serve an ungated points endpoint while looking healthy —
// so that fails Provision.
