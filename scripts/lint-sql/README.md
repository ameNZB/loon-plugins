# lint-sql

Flags any SQL query whose string argument is built with `+` concatenation or
`fmt.Sprintf` — the usual way SQL injection creeps in. Every value should reach
the driver through a `$N` placeholder instead.

Run from the module root:

    go run ./scripts/lint-sql ./...

Exit 1 on any unsuppressed finding, 0 otherwise. (Ported from the ameNZB indexer.)

## Suppressing a finding

Only for dynamic IDENTIFIERS (table/column names, `ORDER BY` direction, an
int-only `IN (...)` list) where the value comes from a hard-coded allowlist —
NEVER for user input. Put on the call line or the line above:

    // sqllint:allow <reason>

Or record a batch of reviewed-safe sites in `baseline.txt` with
`--update-baseline` (only after manually verifying each is safe).
